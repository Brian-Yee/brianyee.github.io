Hey Site-Visitor,

My name is Brian.
For a living I analyze data both for my 9-5 and part-time consulting on the side.
I used to do Theoretical Physics earning an MSc at University of Waterloo with a thesis on [ultra-cold magnets](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/10803) before moving on to earn an MSc info Computer Science at Simon Fraser University.
In between work I train for triathlon, my girlfriend and I are trying to chronologue our journey throughout it on [eutrimonia.com](www.eutrimonia.com). 

You may notice many of the dates of these articles are *old* -- and you would be correct!
The majority of these were written on an old site of mine called [microbrewdata.com](www.microbrewdata.com) which has since been abandonded when I got annoyed with hosting services and decided to switch everything over to Jekyll + Markdown. 
Thus if sometimes you think a link should be present or you have found an inconsistency it was likely in the transcription portion. 
Certainly you will see the logo on some older visualizations.
Please shoot me an email to let me know!

In the meanwhile, I have been inspired to pick up blogging and writing down about personal side projects again. So I hope to be bringing many more posts to this site in the near future. I hope you enjoy your time on the site and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments you may have. 

Cheers,  
Brian
